      Grassroots Economics Foundation, based in Kenya,
      empowers marginalized communities in Africa to trade their own community specific currencies,
      using blockchain technology, to pay for food, education, and health services.
      Local blockchain-based currencies give these communities the tools to pull themselves out of poverty
      by tapping into their underutilized capacity, helping them to develop stable and resilient local economies and
      connecting them to regional markets.
      We operate under the fundamental assumption that the goods, resources,
      and human capacity exist in these communities - the only thing thatâ€™s missing is money.
    </p>

    <p>
      Grassroots enables each community to create and manage their own digital community currency on the blockchain,
      ensuring fast, auditable trading with no transaction fees.
      Grassroots engages a team of local leaders to oversee all onboarding and training of businesses and individuals.
      Each of these community currencies is exchangeable with other community currencies in the region via an open source protocol,
      creating thriving regional economies.
      The system works on feature phones via USSD and doesnâ€™t require smart phones or internet,
      allowing anyone to utilize blockchain technology.
