    <h2>About</h2>

    <h3>üéÅ RadiWhatNows?</h3>

    <p>RadiCards lets you send crypto-ecards to your friends and family.</p>

    <p>What are crypto-ecards? A new type of digital good, built on a Ethereum and IPFS.</p>

    <p>We‚Äôre open source, not for profit, designed and built entirely by a decentralised team of passionate volunteers from the Ethereum community.</p>
    <p>RadiCards started a few weeks back before Christmas ‚Äô18.
      In January ‚Äô19 we've joined forces with CryptoXmas. 
      We believe in a power of collaboration and know that only by committing to it, we will achieve a much bigger impact on our actions.</p>
    <br><br>
    <h3>ü§î But why?</h3>

    <p>Aside from the fact that we know you're probably wanting an excuse to bring up blockchain at [INSERT HOLIDAY] dinner, now more than ever we need to raise awareness and support the fight for freedom around the world.</p>

    <p><ul>
      <li>freedom from war (humanitarian projects)</li>
      <li>freedom from Internet surveillance (online privacy rights projects)</li>
      <li>freedom from extinction (environmental projects)</li>
    </ul></p>

    <p>We‚Äôre also aiming to help speed up the adoption of Web3 technologies, because we think decentralisation is neat.</p>
    <br><br>
    <h3>üõ†Ô∏èÔ∏è What‚Äôs next?</h3>

    <p>You‚Äôd best believe this is just the beginning. We‚Äôve got some pretty neat updates coming soon:‚Ä®</p>

    <p><ul>
      <li>We‚Äôre building a special edition of RadiCards to celebrate Chinese New Year!</li>
      <li>Integrating volca to make possible and send a crypto-ecard to those without a wallet</li>
      <li>More updates are coming. Stay tuned!</li>
    </ul></p>
